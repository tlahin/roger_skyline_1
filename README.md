This subject aims to initiate you to the basics of system and network administration.

We are going to be installing a Virtual Machine and deploying a simple website.

# Installing Virtual Machine
  
  I chose to install Debian since I used it in INIT aswell.
  
  First task was to set 8 GB of disk size to the VM and atleast one partition to be 4.2 GB
  
  Easily configured during the graphical installation of Debian.
  You're able to check the size of the partitions with a command: `sudo fdisk -l`.
 
# Adding rights to sudo

   `usermod -aG sudo username`.
  
   - usermod is the tool that modifies a user account.
  
   - -aG is the option that tells the command to add the user to a specific group. 
   The -a option adds a user to the group without removing it from current groups. 
   The -G option states the group where to add the user.
  
   - sudo is the group we append to the above options. In this case, it is sudo, but it can be any other group.
  
   - username is the name of the user account you want to add to the sudo group.

# Configuring static IP and a Netmask in \30
  
  An amazing guide: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/add-configure-set-up-static-ip-address-on-debianlinux/
  
  `ip -c link show` will show available ethernet network interfaces. Note down the name of the <network>.
  Look for the address of the network by using command `ip -c addr show <network>`.
  
  subnet calculator I used: https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html
  
  Gateway value is found with `ipconfig getoption en0 router` on your MAC.
  In my case it is 10.13.254.254.
  
  Since we want our CIDR to be /30 our subnet mask has to be 255.255.255.252
  
  For my IP I choce 10.13.254.32 from the 64 different network addresses available.
  
  Now we have all the values we need.
  We change our chocen networks settings in `/etc/network/interface`, in my case `enp0s3` to `auto`:

  Then we want to create a configuration file for it: `sudo vim /etc/network/interface.d/<network>`.
  In the file we want to write the values we just gathered:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79833061/171835962-865c86f7-58ef-42fd-b22b-4598bff73960.png).

  After saving your new settings, restart networking by using command: `sudo systemctl restart networking`.
  
# Changing SSH ports

  To edit the SSH settings we use command: `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

  On row number 15 there is `#Port 22` as a default.
  Uncomment it and change the port number according to your liking.
  
  I set my port to `9212`.

  Restart ssh service: `sudo service ssh restart`.

# SSH access with public keys and ROOT access

  If you don't have an existing SSH key yet you can run command: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`.

  Incase you have one already, you can run following command: `ssh-copy-id user@ip -p port`,
  to copy it from your machine to the target location.
  
  Also manually copying your key from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the target location `~/.ssh/authrized_keys` works.

  Editing `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to:
  
  Disabling direct root access.
    `34 PermitRootLogin no`.
  
  Public Key Authentication.
    `39 PubkeyAuthentication yes`.
  
  Location of valid keys.
    `42 AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2`.
  
  Instead of using password to login to the system we want to use our public key, so we disable password authentication.
    `58 PasswordAuthentication no`.
  
  No empty passwords
    `59 PermitEmptyPasswords no`.
  
# Firewall
  
  Tutorial I found on UFW: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands.
  
  UFW stands for uncomplicated firewall, it's included by default within Ubuntu distributions.
  
  Things to note! ðŸ’¡
  
   - You can see the status of UFW and its allowed connections with a command: `sudo ufw status`.

   - Do not enable ufw, if you're using an SSH connection, before configuring it's settings. It might cause some trouble. :)
    
  To begin, we want to make sure our SSH connection to the VM stays open by allowing the connection to the port: 
  `sudo ufw allow <portnumber>/tcp`.
  
  For later purposes we want to enable other connections aswell such as HTTP and HTTPS:
  `sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443`, port 80 being HTTP and 443 being HTTPS.
  
# DoS protection
 
  Installing fail2ban: `sudo apt-get install fail2ban`.
  
  Making a configuration file: `sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local`.
  
# Portscan protection
  
  Source: https://en-wiki.ikoula.com/en/To_protect_against_the_scan_of_ports_with_portsentry.
  
  Insalling portsentry: `sudo apt-get install portsentry`.
  
  First we head to `/etc/default/portsentry` and set out TCP and UDP modes to advanced:
  
    9  TCP_MODE="atcp"
    10 UDP_MODE="audp"
  
  What advanced mode does is portsentry will monitor for any ports below 1024 (by default),
  You can change the default values in `/etec/portsentry/portsentry.conf` on lines 61 and 62,
  but it's not recommended. (see `/etec/portsentry/portsentry.conf` lines 49-58).
  
  Then editing portsentrys configuration in `/etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf` line 113 onwards, we block UDP/TCP scans,
  by changing both number options from 0 ("Do not block UDP/TCP scans") to 1 ("Block UDP/TCP scans").
  
    BLOCK_UDP="1"
    BLOCK_TCP="1"
 
  We opt for a blocking of malicious persons through iptables. First we comment our current `KILL_ROUTE` and uncomment
  the line compatible with iptables: `KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP"`.
  
  You can check that you only have 1 "KILL_ROUTE" active with a command: `cat portsentry.conf | grep KILL_ROUTE | grep -v "#"`.
  
  Once everything is done, restart portsentry: `sudo systemctl restart portsentry`.
# Disable unused services
